      content="Polynomials over Finite Fields
Factorization of polynomials over finite fields, permutation polynomials and their applications to coding theory and cryptography.

Coding Theory
Linear codes, quasi-cyclic codes, linear complementary dual (LCD) codes, linear complementary pair (LCP) of codes, hull of linear codes.

Cryptographically Significant Functions and Related Combinatorial Objects
Functions with high nonlinearity, almost perfect nonlinear functions, bent functions, generalized bent functions and their connection to coding theory, cryptography and combinatorial objects (such as designs, difference sets, graphs, packings and association schemes).

      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.
